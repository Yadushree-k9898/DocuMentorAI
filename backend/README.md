## 🚀 Overview

### ❓ Problem
Reading through long documents like contracts, research papers, or reports is time-consuming and frustrating.

### 💡 Solution
DocuMentor AI uses LLMs (Large Language Models) to make documents interactive. Upload any PDF and ask:
- “What does section 3 say?”
- “Summarize this document.”
- “What are the key points?”
